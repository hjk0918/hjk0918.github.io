<!-- I am a Ph.D. student in [Robot Vision & Learning (RVL) Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) at University of Toronto, advised by Prof. [Florian Shkurti](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/). Prior to this, I obtained a M.S. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, where I had fortunate to work with Prof. [David Held](https://davheld.github.io/) and Prof. [Martial Hebert](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hebert/). I received my Bachelor's degree from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I have been lucky to work with Prof. [Chi-Keung Tang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cktang/bio-sketch-review.htm) and Prof. [Yu-Wing Tai](https://www.cse.ust.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yuwing). I also had an internship in [Tencent Youtu Lab](https://open.youtu.qq.com/#/open).  -->

I'm a year 4 undergraduate in Computer Science & Mathematics at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk), enthusiastic in computer vision and robotics. My research interests lie at the intersection of 3D vision and deep learning. I'm now working on research topics regarding Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), under the supervision of Prof. [Chi-Keung Tang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cktang/bio-sketch-review.htm) and Prof. [Yu-Wing Tai](https://www.cse.ust.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yuwing). I'm applying for a CS Ph.D. position in 2023 Fall!
