Hi there! I will be pursuing my Master's degree in Robotics (MSR) at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu) starting from 2023 Fall! I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk), where I had the honor of working with Prof. [Chi-Keung Tang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~cktang/bio.html) and Prof. [Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning and robotics. I'm currently working on 3D vision research topics regarding the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). As a robotics enthusiast, I'm also passionate about robot manipulation researches. :blue_heart:

Now I'm actively looking for an academic supervisor in CMU. :wave::blush:
