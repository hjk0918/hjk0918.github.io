Hi there! I'm a senior year undergraduate at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk), majoring in Computer Science & Mathematics. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning and robotics. I'm currently working on 3D vision research topics regarding Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), supervised by Prof. [Chi-Keung Tang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~cktang/bio.html) and Prof. [Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io).
