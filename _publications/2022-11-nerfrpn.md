title: "NeRF-RPN: A general framework for object detection in NeRFs"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-11-nerfrpn
excerpt: 'We propose the first significant object detection framework, NeRF-RPN, which directly operates on NeRF. Given a pre-trained NeRF model, NeRF-RPN aims to detect all bounding boxes of objects in a scene, without rendering the NeRF at any viewpoint.'
